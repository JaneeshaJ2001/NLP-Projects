# Meditron-Powered Healthcare Chatbot

This is a Question Answering (QA) bot using retrieved medical documents and the Meditron LLM, a specialized model for the healthcare domain.

## Features
Features:

- Loads PDF documents from a directory.

- Document Ingestion and Text Splitting: The app processes PDFs into manageable chunks using Langchain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for efficient processing.

- PubMedBERT model Embeddings: Converts document chunks into vector embeddings for semantic search and retrieval.

- Saves document chunks to a Chroma vector database.

- Query-Based Document Search: Provides highly relevant document sections based on the semantic similarity to user queries.

- Utilizes a RetrievalQA chain to combine document retrieval with Meditron for answering user queries.
