# ChatGPT-Powered PDF Assistant with Langchain

Leverage the power of Langchain and Streamlit to develop an interactive ChatGPT assistant for your PDF documents. This application allows you to upload PDFs, ask questions about their content, and get accurate, context-based responses from an LLM (Large Language Model), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Features

- Document Ingestion and Text Splitting: The app processes PDFs into manageable chunks using Langchain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for efficient processing.

- OpenAI Embeddings: Converts document chunks into vector embeddings for semantic search and retrieval.

- Vector Store for Fast Retrieval: Uses `FAISS` (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to store and retrieve document chunks based on their similarity to user queries.

- PDF Uploading: Easily upload PDF documents to interact with.

- Query-Based Document Search: Provides highly relevant document sections based on the semantic similarity to user queries.

- Question-Answering with OpenAI's LLM: Combines Langchain's `load_qa_chain` with OpenAIâ€™s GPT model to generate human-like answers to user questions.


## Getting Started

To get the app running, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```plaintext
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Set up environment variables: Ensure you have a .env file in the root directory with the following API key:
```plaintext
    OpenAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
3. Run the Streamlit app: Start the app using the following command:
```plaintext
    streamlit run app.py
```
4. Type in any query related to the PDF content, and get answers generated by the LLM.
